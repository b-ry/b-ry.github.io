intro: I worked on responsive design and user experience of RenoSystemPro's new website. A renovation web app focused on the multi-family and hospitality markets.

RenoSystemPro is a web app for the renovation industry specializing in multi-family and hospitality sectors. The site was to focus on these two markets by providing unique content to each. 


## Homepage

Both markets were of equal importance so we chose a split screen approach for the homepage. A sort of choose your own adventure direction.

<div class="row justify-content-center img-section">

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-4">
		<img src="/assets/img/projects/reno/reno-home-mobile.png" /> 
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<img src="/assets/img/projects/reno/reno-home-full.png" />
	</div>
</div>

## Segment landing page
<div class="row img-section">

	<div class="col-md-4">
		<img src="/assets/img/projects/reno/reno-mobile-landing.png" /> 
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<img src="/assets/img/projects/reno/reno-interior.jpg" />
	</div>
