intro: I find the art printing process amazing. Especially screen printing. I had the opportunity to  created some illustrations for a newspaper ad and a t-shirt design. They were a ton of fun to stretch out and work on something that wasn't digital in nature. Especially the B3 illustration and t-shirt print. That was a completely digital free handmade process from start to finish.

  <p>Beat The Heat was a newspaper ad for a local music store summer sale. The client wanted something fun and off the beaten path. During the time of this project, I was heavily influenced by <a href="https://thebirdmachine.com/" target="_blank">Jay Ryan, of The Bird Machine</a>, a concert poster designer and printer. This was just a natural direction for this client at the time.</p>

  <h3>Process</h3>

  <p>My process for this project involved a little digital but started entirely analog. Sketched a whole bunch of ideas before settling on this composition. Then I broke out the drawing into components. First it was the illustration at the top and then the lettering entirely separate. I then combined those piece in the computer and colored them.</p>

  <h2>b3 T-shirt illustration</h2>

  <p>The B3 was a non-profit venture to bring outdoor adventure and health awareness to Greeley, Colorado. The illustration was created as a unique image to be used on apparel.</p>

  <p>Heavily influenced by Jay Ryan of The Bird Machine. The process was completely done by hand, from the image creation to the hand cut rubylith used for color separations.</p>
