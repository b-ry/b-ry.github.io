intro: I also love drawing and screen printing. I created some illustrations for a newspaper ad and a t-shirt design that have nothing what so ever to do with UX or websites but hey! I think they turned out well so I thought I'd let you take a look.

      <h2>Beat The Heat</h2>
      <p>This project was a newspaper ad for a local music store having a summer sale. The client wanted something fun and off the beaten path. During the time of this project, I was heavily influenced by Jay Ryan, a concert poster designer and printer. This was just a natural direction for this client at the time.</p>

      <h2>b3 T-shirt illustration</h2>

      <p>The B3 was a non-profit venture to bring outdoor adventure and health awareness to Greeley, Colorado. The illustration was created as a unique image to be used on apparel.</p>
      <p>Heavily influenced by Jay Ryan of The Bird Machine. The process was completely done by hand, from the image creation to the hand cut rubylith used for color separations.</p>
