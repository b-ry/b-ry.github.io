intro: The Denver Rescue Mission(DRM) has been changing lives for 125 years. They needed a website refresh, the ability to manage content throughout the organization and most importantly they need to have control and integration with their donation platform Blackbaud. This is where the most impact was made.

  <p>The Newmedia team created an incredibly robust Drupal admin and backend integration with Blackbaud providing the ability to create custom donation forms. This provided a huge amount of flexibility to the DRM team.</p>

  <p>While the backend was being integrated we considered the form. How would it act? Would it be paged or display the who form? Could it help provide feedback about how donations would be spent? Could it help make a emotional connection with the donor to the organization and its cause?</p>

  <h3>Design</h3>

  <h4>The Form</h4>  
  <p>The forms were a major challenge. On the one hand from a business perspective we had to integrate various fields in all kinds of different orders. And on the other hand they needed to be as easy as possible for a donor to fill out in order to complete the donation process. Creating a paged solution proved to be the best way to meet both goals.</p>

  <h4>Emotional Impact</h4>
  <p>While building the forms we asked our selves if there was a bit of a disconnect between some amount a donor might give and how their money would be used. Yes, a major one. This was a huge opportunity. So we presented to the DRM team a solution that provided real time feedback to a donor informing them of what could be accomplished with their donation.
