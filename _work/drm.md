intro: The Denver Rescue Mission(DRM) has been changing lives for 125 years. They needed a website refresh, the ability to manage content throughout the organization and most importantly they need to have control and integration with their donation platform Blackbaud. This is where the most impact was made.

  <p>While at Newmedia the team created an incredibly robust Drupal admin and backend integration with Blackbaud providing the ability to create custom donation forms. This provided a huge amount of flexibility to the DRM team.</p>

  <p>While the backend was being integrated we considered what the what the form would look like. The form we needed to focus our attention on was the main donation form. This is where the majority of donations occur and since we were coming up on their largest giving time of the year it was also the most important.</p>

  <h3>Design</h3>

  <p>We had to consider several things in design. The forms had many fields, we needed to make those forms easy to complete so we made it a multi section form, as one section is completed the donor would move to the next making the form less daunting.</p>

  <p>While we were building the form we thought there was a bit of a disconnect between some amount a donor might give and how their money would be used. To help connect the donation with something more tangible we created a widget that would react with the amount that was selected in the donation form. This solution helped to provide a bit more context and engage an emotional connection for the donor.</p>

    <p>During the first year of usage the 2 months between May 1st and June 30th we witnessed a massive increase in donations from the same time the year before.</p>
