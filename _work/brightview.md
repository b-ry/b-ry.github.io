intro: BrightView is a national landscape management company that wanted to incorporate a ticket system into their product offerings. We designed and built a complete interactive prototype incorporating wire-frames, user flows and interactions.

  <h3>Project Goals</h3>
  <p>BrightView needed to build a resident and infield worker portal to quickly and more accurately manage their properties.Their goals were as follows;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Give access to residents in order to notify BrightView of landscaping tasks outside the norm via a ticket system.</li>
    <li>Allow infield workers to create their own to-dos.</li>
    <li>Keep better track of work.</li>
    <li>Inform clients of work being done above and beyond.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Live Wireframes</h3>
  <p>We created a static site for both wire frames and design. It helped to communicate functionality, user flows, and responsiveness effectively to the client.</p>
  <p>For the development team it helped to accelerate the build process by providing interaction design and many bases styles so that they could get on to the more complex problems.</p>
