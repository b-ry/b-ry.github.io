intro: BrightView is a national landscape management company that wanted to incorporate a ticket system into their product offerings. I designed and built a complete interactive prototype incorporating wire-frames, user flows and interactions.

  <h3>Live Wireframes</h3>
  <p>For this project we created a static site for both wire frames and design. It helped to communicate functionality of elements as well as what the layout would look like at the various breakpoints.</p>
  <p>You can still view the prototype <a class="hover-up" href="http://newmediadenver.github.io/bv">here</a></p>
