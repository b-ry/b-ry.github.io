intro: I worked on user experience and content architecture for Jewish Voice's site redesign.

<div class="body-content two-column">
	<p>Jewish Voice came to us needing to be able to manage their content. They had been using an in-house developer and custom building pages as they needed them. This process began to present issues so they wanted to get the site into a CMS. Additionally they wanted a redesign to freshen up their look and attract a younger audience while maintaining an interface that helped older users get to the content they desired.</p>

	<h2>Content Structure</h2>

	<p>Working with the client on content structure was one of the challenges we faced. Since they had been custom building their content as needed there wasn't a consistent structure to that content. We worked internally to help develop a way to visualize and understand their content with Content Templates, then moved into wire frames.</p>

	<h2>Wire frames</h2>

	<p>Reorganizing content so that it was more accessible and visible at a higher level was one of the main goals.</p>

	<p>For the Watch page, it was most important to be being able to see chronologically when something aired and then filtering rapidly to discover the content a user is after.</p>
