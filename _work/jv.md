intro: I worked on user experience and content architecture for Jewish Voice's site redesign.
---

Jewish Voice came to us needing to be able to manage their content. They had been using an in-house developer and custom building pages as they needed them. This process began to present issues so they wanted to get the site into a CMS. Additionally they wanted a redesign to freshen up their look and attract a younger audience while maintaining an interface that helped older users get to the content they desired. 

## Content Structure

Working with the client on content structure was one of the challenges we faced. Since they had been custom building their content as needed there wasn't a consistent structure to that content. We worked internally to help develop a way to visualize and understand their content with Content Templates, then moved into wire frames.

## Wire frames

Reorganizing content so that it was more accessible and visible at a higher level was one of the main goals. 

For the Watch page, it was most important to be being able to see chronologically when something aired and then filtering rapidly to discover the content a user is after.
