Jewish Voice came to us needing to be able to manage their content. They had been using an in-house developer and custom building pages as they needed them. This process began to present issues so they wanted to get the site into a CMS. Additionally they wanted a redesign to freshen up their look and attract a younger audience while maintaining an interface that helped older users get to the content they desired. 

## Content Structure

Working with the client on content structure was one of the challenges we faced. Since they had been custom building their content as needed there wasn't a consistent structure to that content. We worked internally to help develop a way to visualize and understand their content with Content Templates. From there we moved into wire frames.

## Wire frames

Reorganizing content so that it was more accessible and visible at a higher level was one of the main goals. 

For the Watch page, being able to see chronologically when something aired and then filtering rapidly to discover the content a user is after was the most important.
