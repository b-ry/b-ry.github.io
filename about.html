            <ul>
                <li>I am a staunch believer that designers should know basic front-end skills. It only helps your design, communication and understanding of the digital medium.</li>
                <li>Good feedback is golden. Feedback is the key to growth.</li>
                <li>Start with pencil and paper. It is so much faster and freeing to work through problems without letting the computer get in the way.</li>
                <li>I am interested in designing and building products that really help people.</li>
