			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I am a maker focusing on website design and development. I've worked on projects from brochure sites to eCommerce and Web applications. I also enjoy other tangible forms of design like screen-printing and woodworking.</p>
			<p>I am energized by doing creative work that benefits users. My background is in visual design and I have working knowledge of the user centered design process. I can also get around front-end code. This makes me flexible, able to work both as a designer and a front end developer, but more importantly, able to effectively communicate with both teams.</p>
